I have set up rofi + brotab to quickly search through firefox tabs, select_ff_tabs.sh
Based on the ideas from:
https://adrianpopagh.blogspot.com/2020/12/quick-launcher-with-firefox-tabs-rofi.html

(brotab requires Firefox/Chromium extension, there are alternatives to that)
(as a very simple alternative, use get_firefox_tabs.py)
